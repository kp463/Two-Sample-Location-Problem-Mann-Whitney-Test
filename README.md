# Two Sample Location Problem: Mann-Whitney Test

## Overview  

This project investigates nonparametric testing methods for comparing two samples when the underlying distributions are completely unknown. Through extensive simulation studies, it evaluates the behavior, robustness, and performance of the test statistic under different scenarios, providing both theoretical and empirical insights.

## Features

- Demonstrates how to test if two samples come from the same population without distributional assumptions.
- Examines the distribution-free property of the statistic under both null and alternative hypotheses.
- Derives and validates the asymptotic distribution under different conditions.
- Investigates the impact of discrete data on the test performance.
- Estimates size and power across various distributions, with detailed power comparisons.
- Explores the parametric counterpart through tests for location parameters.
